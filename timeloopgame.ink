You are a futuristic scientist tasked with creating a cure for a deadly plague. You must experiment with different combinations of colored serums to create the cure. Each loop begins with a limited set of serums.

The current loop is {loop}.

You are in your lab. What will you do?

Congratulations! You have successfully created the perfect cure and broken the time loop. Humanity is saved!

The setup did not produce the right cure. You feel a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu as the time loop resets.
